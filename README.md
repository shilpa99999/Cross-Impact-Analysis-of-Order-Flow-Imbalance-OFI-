# Cross-Impact-Analysis-of-Order-Flow-Imbalance-OFI-
Cross-Impact of Order Flow Imbalance in Equity Markets

The goal of this task is to assess your ability to process high-frequency equity market data,
compute Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) metrics across multiple levels of the Limit Order Book
(LOB), and evaluate cross-asset impacts on short-term price changes. You will implement the
methodologies outlined in the paper "Cross-Impact of Order Flow Imbalance in Equity
Markets" to complete this task. Additionally, you will demonstrate your skills in creating a
well-documented GitHub repository and a concise LaTeX-based report summarizing your
approach and findings.

Objective is to:

1. Compute OFI Metrics:
   
○ Derive multi-level OFI metrics (up to 5 levels) for each stock in the dataset.

○ Integrate these multi-level OFIs into a single metric using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) or another dimensionality reduction method.

2. Analyze Cross-Impact:
   
○ Examine the contemporaneous cross-impact of OFI on short-term price changes
across stocks.

○ Evaluate the predictive power of lagged cross-asset OFI on future price changes
(e.g., 1-minute and 5-minute horizons).

3. Quantify Results:
   
○ Use regression models to assess the explanatory power of contemporaneous
OFI and predictive power of lagged OFI.

○ Compare self-impact (within the same stock) vs. cross-impact (between stocks)
in your models.

4. Visualization and Reporting:
 
○ Create visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots) to illustrate cross-impact
relationships and OFI trends.

○ Summarize your findings in a concise report.
